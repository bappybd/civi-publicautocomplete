civi-publicautocomplete
=======================

This civicrm extension allows an anonymous user to have an autocomplete field instead of a free form one for the current employer, to avoid mispelled/duplicate organisation names  tested on profile edit (/civicrm/profile/create) and event registration (/civicrm/event/register), patch welcome for the rest.
